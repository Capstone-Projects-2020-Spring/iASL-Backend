# iASL-Backend

This repository is intended to contain the back-end material for the iASL application. Specifically, it will contain the machine learning model for the neural network used in this application.

The main code for running the training portion of the model can be found in the "scripts" folder. The main script, "train.sh," runs the training network and saves the model to the folder "output/p1_train". The training process results in three files being saved, as well as one additional weights file for every epoch.
